[Haiku rules](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/style-and-usage/rules-for-writing-haiku.html):

> There are no specific rules for writing haiku; however, the structure of haiku is always the same, including the following features:  
> - Only three lines, totaling 17 syllables throughout  
> - The first line is only 5 syllables  
> - The second line is 7 syllables  
> - The third line is 5 syllables like the first  
> - Punctuation and capitalization rules are up to the poet, and need not follow rigid rules used in structuring sentences  
> - Haiku does not have to rhyme, in fact many times it does not rhyme at all  
> - Some haiku can include the repetition of words or sounds

## Versions

There's a lot of ways to do this, so decided to keep the different versions so you can play with all of them.

#### V1

Uses random words for the whole haiku. These are _real_ english words.

````
$> cd v1
$> npm install
$> node haiku.js
````

#### V2

You can suggest a word so the haiku is related to the "theme". Uses an [API](https://api.datamuse.com) to get related words.

````
$> cd v1
$> npm install
$> node haiku.js wind // haiku hopefully related to wind
````

## Make it talk

Use this command to make the computer read the generated haiku

````
$> node haiku.js <additional params> | tee /dev/tty | say
````
